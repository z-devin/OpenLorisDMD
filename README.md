### Introduction to OpenLORIS-Object

[OpenLORIS-Object](https://lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/dataset/object.html) is a dataset specifically designed for lifelong robotic vision tasks. It includes [RGB-D images](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/depth-in-focus-d-component-of-rgb-d-images-and-videos) of 69 object instances across 19 categories, collected under various environmental conditions. A more detailed description about how the data was collected can be found in [the associated paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06487). This dataset is particularly useful for testing the robustness of object recognition algorithms under changing conditions, which aligns well with the capabilities of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).

### Project Objectives

1. Apply DMD to analyze object recognition under varying environmental conditions
2. Utilize DMD for temporal analysis of video sequences
3. Evaluate the robustness of DMD-based object recognition

### Approach

Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
Step 2: DMD Analysis across Environmental Factors
Step 3: Comparative Analysis Across Environmental Factors
Step 4: Reconstruction Quality Analysis
